# 👋 Hi, I’m Turtleca!

## 🎓 Profession/Role
Student researcher with a passion for observational astrophysics. I love exploring the universe by combining physics and data!

## 🛠️ Top Skills
- Python (my go-to language for research)
- Data Analysis (from crunching numbers to visualizing results)
- Curve Fitting (especially for supernova light curves!)
- A bit of Java (Taking a course on it RN)

## 🚀 Favorite Projects
- **Supernova Curve Fitting Model**  
  My pride and joy! I built a model to fit light curves of supernovae—shedding light on stellar explosions.
- **Gravitational Simulation** *(in progress)*  
  Currently crafting a Python-based simulation to explore gravitational dynamics. Stay tuned!

## 🎮 Interests & Hobbies
- Playing singleplayer games (always up for a new adventure)
- Doing random physics experiments and explorations in my free time
